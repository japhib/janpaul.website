      <description>In my last post, I detailed all the many reasons why I dislike Unity and find it frustrating to work with. Despite all those reasons, I&amp;rsquo;ve released a commercial game built with Unity and am close to releasing a second. That amounts to several years of working with Unity &amp;ndash; if I hate it so much, why haven&amp;rsquo;t I bailed before now?
Well, the reason is that the good parts of Unity outweigh the costs for me.</description>

      <title>The quest for the Ultimate Game Engine</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Unity for about 4 years now. I&amp;rsquo;ve even used it to develop a couple of commercial projects. So obviously, it can get the job done. It has a huge community and there are tons of high-quality tutorials online. It appears to be the most-used game engine among indies and hobbyists. And best of all, it&amp;rsquo;s free.
&amp;hellip; so what&amp;rsquo;s my gripe with it?
A lot of things, really.</description>
