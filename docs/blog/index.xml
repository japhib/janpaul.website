      <description>Godot (pronounced &amp;ldquo;guh-DOE&amp;rdquo;) is a fully open-source game engine that aims to compete with giants like Unity and Unreal. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about it in the past, and at that time I was pretty harsh:
GDScript is terrible. I refuse to use a language that I will only ever use for this one particular program. They do have C# support through Mono, which is cool. And it does have some other nice features, like first-class 2d support (including 2d lighting!</description>

It has a huge community and there are tons of high-quality tutorials online. It appears to be the most-used game engine among indies and hobbyists. And best of all, it&amp;rsquo;s free.

A lot of things, really.</description>
