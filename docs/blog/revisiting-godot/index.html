			<p><a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> (pronounced &ldquo;guh-DOE&rdquo;) is a <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot">fully open-source</a> game engine that aims to compete with giants like Unity and Unreal. I&rsquo;ve written about it <a href="/blog/ultimate-game-engine/">in the past</a>, and at that time I was pretty harsh:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GDScript is terrible. I refuse to use a language that I will only ever use for this one particular program. They do have C# support through Mono, which is cool. And it does have some other nice features, like first-class 2d support (including 2d lighting!). However, most of the rest of the engine feels pretty bad, and when I’m using it, I can’t help but think, “this is just a crappier version of Unity!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, when I wrote that, I had only played with Godot a tiny bit. Since then, I&rsquo;ve fiddled around with it a bit more, and I have to admit that it&rsquo;s a lot nicer than I gave it credit for.</p>
<h1 id="gdscript">GDScript</h1>
<p>GDScript is the main scripting language that Godot supports. GDScript is a Python-like language, with some <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/faq.html#what-is-gdscript-and-why-should-i-use-it">Godot-specific innovations</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Threading support</strong> (a rarity in dynamic scripting languages such as Python and Lua)</li>
<li>Simple and straightforward <strong>C++ bindings</strong>, including the ability to <strong>extend C++ classes</strong> - object-orientation is a staple of Godot&rsquo;s architecture</li>
<li><strong>Native, value-based vector types</strong> (Vector3, Matrix4). Typical scripting languages like Lua, Python, and Javascript only support reference-based user classes, which generates a lot of garbage</li>
<li>Memory management using <strong>reference counting</strong> rather than garbage collection, eliminating unpredictable GC pauses</li>
<li>Tight IDE integration - Godot has an <strong>embedded GDScript code editor</strong>, providing in-editor docs, code completion (for <em>your project&rsquo;s</em> assets!), live editing, and other tools</li>
</ol>
<p>In my <a href="/blog/ultimate-game-engine/">other blog post</a> I <em>specifically</em> lamented the lack of value types in languages such as Java, Javascript, and Lua. GDScript directly fixes that flaw.</p>
<p>Another rant I had in that blog post was that in Unity, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not coding, you&rsquo;re &lsquo;scripting&rsquo;.&rdquo; Godot actually leans into this with GDScript by making the scripting language itself very lightweight, and tightly integrated with the engine. IMO this is a better solution. It&rsquo;s easy and fast to make a new GDScript script &ndash; you don&rsquo;t even have to wait for it to compile! Plus, it makes it very clear that you&rsquo;re not using regular C#, you&rsquo;re using a language specific to this game engine.</p>
<p>There are some situations where I still wouldn&rsquo;t use GDScript. For example, if I were to make a game like <a href="https://pollywog.games/barnards-star.html">Barnard&rsquo;s Star</a> where I needed to run the game logic on a server outside of the game engine, I&rsquo;d use C# instead. I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s any way to run GDScript outside of Godot Engine itself.</p>
<p>To sum up, when I actually gave GDScript a chance, it quickly became clear that it&rsquo;s a well-thought-out language that solves a lot of problems.</p>
<h1 id="godot-the-future">Godot: the future???</h1>
<p>Godot is far from perfect, but I love that it&rsquo;s open source. Unity has served us well enough, but with all its warts, I&rsquo;d love to try something else out for a change. My current project, Barnard&rsquo;s Star, is much too far gone to switch engines at this point &ndash; I&rsquo;ve got 20k lines of Unity-specific C#, and another 30k+ lines of game logic C#. But next time I start a new project, I&rsquo;d love to start it on Godot!</p>
