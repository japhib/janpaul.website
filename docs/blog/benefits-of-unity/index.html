<p>In my <a href="ultimate-game-engine.html">last post</a>, I detailed all the many reasons why I dislike Unity and find it frustrating to work with. Despite all those reasons, I&rsquo;ve released <a href="https://pollywog.games/card-crusade.html">a commercial game</a> built with Unity and am close to releasing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1217500/Barnards_Star/">a second</a>. That amounts to <strong>several years</strong> of working with Unity &ndash; if I hate it so much, why haven&rsquo;t I bailed before now?</p>
<p>Well, the reason is that the good parts of Unity outweigh the costs for me. I may or may not keep using it for future projects, but these are the reasons why it&rsquo;s been good enough for past and current projects. I&rsquo;ve already gone into <em>excruciating</em> detail on my gripes about the engine, so to be fair I need to talk about the benefits of it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>Like the last post, a lot of these benefits are specific to me and don&rsquo;t necessarily apply to other people, with a different background or different goals.</em></p>
<h3 id="the-editor-isnt-that-bad-and-can-actually-be-pretty-nice-for-certain-things">The editor isn&rsquo;t that bad, and can actually be pretty nice for certain things</h3>
<p>For better or worse, the Unity editor is a huge part of the development process. This was especially annoying at first, but after using Unity for a while, I&rsquo;ve become quite comfortable in how to use it. So I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that bad anymore.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, there are certain tasks that the editor actually does make quite a bit easier. For instance, <strong>putting together a GUI.</strong> Doing this with code only involves a lot of making small changes to numbers and then restarting the application to see what it looks like now. This is a tedious process. And if your code has to re-compile each time it&rsquo;s changed, that slows the process down even further. Having a visual editor for this type of thing allows you to adjust stuff based on what it looks like, and have <em>immediate</em> feedback, which you can then use to make further adjustments.</p>
<p>This applies to all visual things in general. If you&rsquo;re working on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_system">particle effect</a>, you&rsquo;re making a lot of small changes and seeing how that affects its look. Or lighting in a scene, or colors for a sprite, etc. And since a game is largely made up of its visuals, being able to adust and iterate on these things can make a big difference.</p>
<h3 id="unity-supports-all-the-platforms-i-care-about">Unity supports all the platforms I care about</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure the name &ldquo;Unity&rdquo; comes from the idea that you can write your code once and export it to any platform. While I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s <em>entirely</em> true &ndash; there are significant differences between the platforms that you do need to take into account &ndash; it does make the process easier.</p>
<p>I got a taste of the difficulty of exporting to different platforms when I was fiddling with my own C++ game engine a while ago. I only wanted to support Windows, Mac, and web (via <a href="https://emscripten.org">Emscripten</a>), which is a far cry from the number of platforms supported by Unity:</p>
<p><img src="/img/unity_supported_platforms.png" alt=""></p>
<p>See, the challenge isn&rsquo;t just in getting the code to <em>compile</em> for the platform you&rsquo;re targeting, although that is definitely an issue. One big issue is that there are a lot of different APIs you have to use depending on the device you&rsquo;re targeting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For instance, for graphics you might think, &ldquo;OpenGL is supported everywhere, why not just use that?&rdquo; and you&rsquo;d be partially right, because it&rsquo;s not quite OpenGL everywhere. It&rsquo;s OpenGL on desktop platforms, WebGL on the web, and OpenGL ES on mobile platforms, each a slightly different flavor of the API. And if I wanted to export to Xbox, PS4/5, or Switch, it&rsquo;d be a totally different, proprietary API. It&rsquo;s the same story for sound and input &ndash; no matter how cross-platform you may think the library is that you&rsquo;re using, there&rsquo;s going to be significant differences getting it to run exactly how you want when you move to a new platform.</p>
<p>Another issue is that file system access is not entirely the same. This is mainly an issue between desktop and web, since a program running in your browser doesn&rsquo;t have any filesystem to access to actually load your files from. But even then, there are lots of annoying things to worry about in C++. Do I use forward slashes or backslashes for file paths? How do I know where to go to find the asset files for the game? Why does everything in the Windows API use <code>WCHAR</code> instead of a regular <code>char</code>? In Unity this is auto-magically solved because all your files are bundled and loaded for you by the engine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even going to go into the difficulties of trying to build and debug a C++ app on iOS and Android. I haven&rsquo;t done it yet, but I&rsquo;m pretty intimidated by it. I would much rather deal with Unity&rsquo;s quirks than try to demystify the arcane secrets of the Android NDK.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s not <em>possible</em> to work out all those things. But so far, my goal has been to finish these games, and Unity allows me to do that without having to make my own engine.</p>
<p>All you have to do (more or less) is click &ldquo;Build&rdquo; and it builds for the target of your choice. They also offer Unity Cloud Build for $9/month which is nice for pumping out the builds without having to take up time doing it on your computer. It still has some problems, like if you&rsquo;re having an iOS-specific issue, the debug cycle is a pain because you have to make a new build every time you make a change. But overall, Unity works <em>well enough</em> on all the platforms that I care about that it&rsquo;s worth it to me.</p>
<h3 id="i-like-c">I like C#</h3>
<p>C# is nice. I enjoy coding in it.</p>
<p>It has a progressive feature set, including stuff like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/var">the <code>var</code> keyword</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/">LINQ</a> for functional programming using <code>List</code>s, <code>Dictionary</code>s and other collections,</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine">coroutines</a> via <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/yield">the yield statement</a>,</li>
<li>and even <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/">async/await</a> if you want to get fancy.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also has <a href="http://clarkkromenaker.com/post/csharp-structs/">stack-allocated structs</a> so you can avoid a fair amount of garbage-collection. That&rsquo;s critical for real-time games, and it&rsquo;s a feature that Java, Lua, Haxe, Javascript, and most other languages don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<h3 id="it-has-a-huge-community">It has a HUGE community</h3>
<p>I can&rsquo;t find it now, but I saw a tweet a while back that said something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unity sucks, but the community is big enough that no matter what problem you&rsquo;re having, you can google it and you&rsquo;ll find 6 different ways to solve it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m <em>pretty</em> sure Unity is the most popular game engine out there. It definitely seems so when you&rsquo;re googling stuff. It may not be the best, or the fastest, and it has its fair share of bugs and crashes and broken or unfinished features. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter because no matter what you want to do, there&rsquo;s a huge amount of content online telling you how to do it. That&rsquo;s something that can&rsquo;t necessarily be said about the other engines &amp; frameworks I&rsquo;ve used.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine, I know how to use it, and I know how to find help when I&rsquo;m stuck. That&rsquo;s pretty much all this boils down to.</p>
<p>I do still want to fiddle with other engines &ndash; I just got accepted into the <a href="https://luxeengine.com/">Luxe</a> closed beta! &ndash; and hope to make more progress on my own custom game engine at some point. But these are the reasons I&rsquo;ve stuck with Unity so far.</p>
