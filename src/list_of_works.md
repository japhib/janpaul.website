# Portunica

This is the original project that rekindled my interest in gamedev during my adult life. I started working on it in 2017 with my older brother David, whose original idea it was.

It's based originally on a turn-based strategy game called [Outwitters](http://onemanleft.com/games/outwitters/), but we stole a lot of gameplay from a game called [Antiyoy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yio.tro.antiyoy.android).

Since it was my first Unity project, it has a *lot* of issues. We had a grand vision for the game but ultimately our lack of experience & diverging design ideas took their toll and we stopped development to work on other things. My fascination with asynchronous multiplayer, however, lives on in Barnard's Star!
