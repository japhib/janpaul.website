title: Response to "What to do about the police", pt. 1
description: it's a bit more complicated than "should police exist"

This post is a response to my brother Lincoln's post on _his_ blog, ["What to do about the police."](https://chalcidfly.repl.co/posts/police/) Lincoln and I are very similar in a lot of ways, but NOT politically. Normally I'd just make a jokey jab in his Twitter replies, but this time I've decided to write up some full posts of my own.

In Lincoln's post, he makes several points:
- Defunding the police is obviously a terrible idea
- Government-funded police are useless and privately funded security forces should enforce the law instead
- There should be no restrictions of any kind on guns
- Property owners should have every right to use their guns to defend their property
- While we're at it, let's privatize all public schools

Given the timing of the post (just a few days after the tragic mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, TX that resulted in the deaths of 19 kids and 3 adults), I'm going to assume that the goal of most of these changes would be to reduce the likelihood of such a tragedy happening again.

However, I truly believe that any of these ideas, if implemented, would result in much, much worse outcomes for literally everyone involved. In this post, I'll respond to the first idea. Then hopefully in the future I'll make a few more posts to respond to the rest.

# Re: Defunding the Police

## Fallacy #1: the police prevent crime

Let's get one thing out of the way right out of the gate:

**The police do not _prevent_ crime. They _respond_ to crime, after it has already happened.**

Maybe in some cases, the police can prevent crime -- for example, there happens to be a cop parked at a gas station, and a would-be thief sees them there and thinks better of their plan to rob the place. But since it is, of course, impossible for the police to be in all possible places where a crime could be committed, they can't deter much crime this way.

Lincoln said this:

> If you were a criminal, would you prefer your victims to be stronger or weaker? More of a threat to you, or less? Which would allow you to get away with the various abuses and criminal acts you intend on doing?

But police do not make crime victims stronger. They do not make crime victims more of a threat. They do hopefully do their best to catch criminals after the fact, although in many cases (e.g. mass murder) catching the criminal and inflicting even the harshest penalty possible (i.e. the death penalty) does not even begin to right the wrong that has been done.

## Solution #1: social programs _do_ reduce crime

"Defund the police" generally doesn't mean financially crippling the police, so much that they just can't operate at all. It means taking part of the usually-oversized police budgets and putting that money towards social programs.

**Point #1: police budgets are usually oversized**

Just a few examples:
- In Uvalde, TX the police budget is [40% of the city budget](https://theintercept.com/2022/05/25/texas-uvalde-shooting-school-police/)
- In New York City, [the police budget is $6 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/20/nyregion/defund-police-nypd-budget.html), which is only about 6% of the city budget, but still insanely huge. To give an idea, there are 52,000 law enforcement employee in a city of 8 million -- about 1 law enforcement employee for every 150 people in the city. ([source](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/06/26/how-much-money-goes-to-police-departments-in-americas-largest-cities/112004904/)) Yet, when you think of safe cities in America, does NYC come to mind?
- In Los Angeles, CA the police budget is $2 billion, which is 20% of the city budget. ([source](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/06/26/how-much-money-goes-to-police-departments-in-americas-largest-cities/112004904/)) Yet, LA is another city that is considered high-crime.

**Point #2: social programs reduce crime**

There's not some class of people that just _love_ to be criminals. People don't wake up one morning and think, "hey, I'll rob a bank today!" Like _maybe_ someone somewhere, but the majority of people committing crimes are driven to it by external negative pressures in their lives.

Things like an abusive childhood, being bullied, never having enough to eat, feeling like society failed them, being homeless for an extended period of time, etc. are all the type of factors that can pressure someone into criminal acts.

With that in mind, rather than increasing the punishment for a crime, what'd be better is solving the underlying issues. "Social programs" is the catch-all phrase I'm using to refer to stuff like:

- unemployment benefits
- free or cheap health insurance
- homeless shelters
- affordable housing
- crisis shelters
- programs for women & children in abusive family situations to escape
- programs for drug addicts that focus on rehabilitation and recovery rather than punishment

These all improve the quality of life of the less-fortunate people that are more likely to commit a crime.

And suddenly, the person that was going to rob a rich dude because they never have enough money for basic necessities, has their needs satisfied and won't rob that rich dude anymore.

Some studies that back up this point of view:
- [How does the welfare state reduce crime?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235220300623)
- [Community Organizations Have Important Role in Lowering Crime Rates](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/community-organizations-have-important-role-lowering-crime-rates)
- [Welfare Payments and Crime](https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/Intellectual_Life/FoleyCrimeFeb08_(2).pdf)

# Aside: abortions

This is kind of similar to a (demonstrably false) idea in the abortion debate -- that restricting abortion access reduces the amount of abortions people will have.

One big goal on the conservative side is to reduce "immorality", i.e. the amount of sex between unmarried people. The argument is that if people have heavier consequences for sex, that is, they have to raise a baby afterwards, they'll take it more seriously and have less sex.

However, restricting abortion access [doesn't actually lower the rates of abortions](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/21/health/abortion-restriction-laws/index.html) that people have.

What _does_ decrease the amount of abortions is solving the underlying issue, which is that people have unprotected sex when they don't actually want to get pregnant. This is solved by:

1. Sex education (other than abstinence-only)
2. Access to birth control
3. Making it easier to raise a baby with stuff like child tax credits, child care subsidies, low-cost or free health insurance, etc.

# The American Dream

The media (especially right-wing media, but center/left media is often guilty of this as well) loves to demonize poor people, drug addicts, the homeless, and anyone that upper-class white people generally don't like to be around. It's a convenient narrative that we just need more police to keep them in line, since that reinforces the "us vs. them" worldview.

But what's the American Dream?

It's that **no matter your background, anyone can become successful through hard work and dedication.**

So rather than punching down at those less fortunate than us, let's remember that our ancestors were once just as disadvantaged, and they got a new start by coming to America. Everyone deserves a second chance.

And maybe more importantly, everyone needs to feel like they belong, and that someone is looking out for them. Enacting policies that allow people to get back on their feet after challenging times is a great way to reduce crime.
