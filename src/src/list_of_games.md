## Card Crusade

My first commercial game! I worked on this with my brother Lincoln for about a year and we released it in early 2019. We did this under the banner of [Pollywog Games](https://pollywog.games).

It got a pretty good response from reviewers:

- [‘Card Crusade’ Review – A New Classic in Roguelike Deck Builders](https://toucharcade.com/2019/03/07/card-crusade-review/) (Touch Arcade, 4.5 stars)
- [Card Crusade review - "Another interesting take on the card-based dungeon crawler"](https://www.pocketgamer.com/articles/080010/card-crusade-review/) (Pocket Gamer, 3.5 stars)
- [Card Crusade excels at providing fast-paced card combat](https://www.148apps.com/reviews/card-crusade-review/) (148apps, 4 stars)

Pocket Tactics also wrote a review for us, and at one point we made it onto their "Best Mobile Roguelikes" list. However, their site has been heavily updated and it looks like those have both been removed.

## Portunica

This is the original project that rekindled my interest in gamedev during my adult life. I started working on it in 2017 with my older brother David, whose original idea it was.

It's based originally on a turn-based strategy game called [Outwitters](http://onemanleft.com/games/outwitters/), but we stole a lot of gameplay from a game called [Antiyoy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yio.tro.antiyoy.android).

Since it was my first Unity project, it has a *lot* of issues. We had a grand vision for the game but ultimately our lack of experience & diverging design ideas took their toll and we stopped development to work on other things. My fascination with asynchronous multiplayer, however, lives on in Barnard's Star!
