I'm a software engineer based in Utah, USA.

For my day job, I work as a backend engineer for [Divvy](https://getdivvy.com/home/), using the [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) programming language.

I'm also one half of [Pollywog Games](https://pollywog.games/), where I make mobile strategy games as a hobby.
