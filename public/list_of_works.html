        <h1>Portunica</h1>

<p></p>

<p>This is the original project that rekindled my interest in gamedev during my adult life. I started working on it in 2017 with my older brother David, whose original idea it was.</p>

<p>It's based originally on a turn-based strategy game called <a href="http://onemanleft.com/games/outwitters/">Outwitters</a>, but we stole a lot of gameplay from a game called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yio.tro.antiyoy.android">Antiyoy</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Since it was my first Unity project, it has a <em>lot</em> of issues. We had a grand vision for the game but ultimately our lack of experience &amp; diverging design ideas took their toll and we stopped development to work on other things. My fascination with asynchronous multiplayer, however, lives on in Barnard's Star!</p>
